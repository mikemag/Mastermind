    "# Symmetry and Case Equivalence in Mastermind\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the Mastermind algorithms used here score all codewords, $AC$, against a diminishing set of remaining possibilities, $PS$, in order to subset them. The sizes of these subsets guide algorithms, such as Kinth's[1], to pick the next best guess to be played. Because there are $c^p$ codewords, this step is the most computationally intensive. Any reduction in $|AC|$ for  given $PS$ is welcomed, and indeed required for larger games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ville[2], section 5.4, introduces the notions of symmetry and case equivalence to provide just such a reduction. This doc expands on these ideas, and shows that we can pre-compute the sizes of these reduced $AC$ sets, $AC_r$, and share them across different $PS$. The optimized CPU solver in this repo, `SolverCPUFaster`, uses this to reduce its work or each $PS$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sizes are used by the CUDA solver to pack many $AC_r$ into a fixed-sized buffer, and share them across multiple $PS$, without extra intermediate space.\n",

    "## Rewriting to a Class Representative\n",
    "\n",
    "For any $p$ pin and $c$ color game, after each guess played we may have a set of *zero* colors (those which simply cannot be part of the secret), and a set of *free* colors (those which we have not yet played in this game). Given these we wish to reduce $AC$ to only those codewords which, when scored against $PS$, will provide new information and subset $PS$. For any given $PS$, there are many codewords which will provide the same outcome based on $zero$ and $free$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example is given a $4p6c$ game, and $zero={1,2}$, we can quickly see that ${1134, 1234, 2134, 2234}$ will all yield the same information. These codewords are *case equivalent*, and for any such set we would like to find its *class representative*, in this case $1134$. We need only play the class representative for each set, and thus reduce $AC$ accordingly. For zero colors, replacing all of them with the lexically first zero color produces the class representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, consider the same game and $free={3,4,5,6}$, which is the result of playing $1122$ initially. Again, we can see that ${3333, 4444, 5555, 6666}$ all yield the same information with regard to splitting $PS$ into further subsets. However, it is not sufficient to replace all free colors with the same one. Consider ${1556, 1565}$. The ordering of the free colors is important, and these two yield different subsets. Free colors in a codeword must be replaced, in order of appearance, with a free color in lexical order. For the codewords ${1553, 1554, 1555, 1556, 1535, 1545, 1565}$ the class representatives are ${1334, 1333, 1343}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I will use a valid codeword as the class representative for each set. Ville suggests replacing $zero$ colors with $z$ and $free$ colors, in order of appearance, with ${a,b,c,...}$. I replace $zero$ colors with the lexically first color in $zero$, and each color in $free$ with the lexically first colors in turn, in the same manner. Note carefully that all of our gameplay algorithms select the lexically first codeword when presented with multiple choices for a next best guess. It is therefore important that the class representative be the lexically first in its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a valid, lexically first codeword as the class representative we can simplify the comparison and storage costs of rewriting $AC$."

    "The free colors are easy to determine: given a history of guesses played up to the current point, which of the $c$ colors are not present in any of them?\n",
    "\n",
    "The zero colors are also straightforward. As guesses are played we learn a number of rules about what the secret might be. If you play yourself, you might codify these in your mind as \"1 cannot be in the second position, there must be a 3 in the first or fourth position, there must be a 2 or a 3, etc.\" However, all of these rules are implicitly encoded by $PS$, as we've removed any codeword not consistent with the guesses played at each round. Therefore, simply scanning over $PS$, we can see that any color not represented cannot be in the secret, and is thus a zero color.\n"

    "\n",

    "The simplest case is to consider any game of $c>2$ colors, with two zero colors and no free colors. We only need to consider codewords without the zero colors, and we could form these $(c-2+1)^p$ codewords trivially.\n",

    "Free colors are more interesting, and we will use an additive approach to construct the set. To start, consider the same game, with no zero colors and two free colors. The codewords without the free colors would be unchanged in any rewriting, so we have a baseline of $(c-2)^p$ colors to start with. We must now figure out how to form codewords using the free colors in combindation with the codewords in the baseline. The approach is to form valid sequences of free colors, of lengths $1 \\dots p$, then permute those with the basline.\n",

This constraint ensures that we replace free colors by the first observed in order, as suggested in Ville[2]. Note that we are only interested in $|G_x|$; we will form the sequences conceptually to motivate the calculation.\n",

    "Now, what sequences can we form with $P_3=(a,b,c)$? Building upon $G_2$, we can see that we will be appending individual symbols from $P_3$. $P_2$ produced one sequence which only contains the first symbol, and one sequence which contained both. This first sequence $(a,a)$ can only support the addition of the first two symbols in $P_3$, i.e., $P_2$, while the last sequence $(a,b)$ can support the addition of all symbols in $P_3$. Thus, we can form $G_3=\\{(a,a,a), (a,a,b), (a,b,a), (a,b,b), (a,b,c)\\}$, the first two built from $(a,a)$ and the next three built from $(a,b)$.\n",

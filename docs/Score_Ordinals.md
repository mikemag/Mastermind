# Packed Indices for Mastermind Scores

Mastermind guesses are evaluated against the secret and given a score made up of a number of black (*b*) and white (*w*) hits.
Black hits are awarded for every correct color in the correct position, and white hits are awarded for every correct 
color in the wrong position. Each colored pin in the secret can be used only once. Scores are typically represented
by the two numbers *b* and *w*, either as separate values or packed together into a single value.
Games have a number of pins *p* and colors *c*.

A reasonable human-readable packing for up to 9 pins is *b * 10 + w*, so a score of *b = 2* *w = 1* would be 21.

Packing the result into a single byte is reasonable for games with up to 15 pins with *(b << 4) | w*, so the same score
would be 0x21.

These are reasonable representations, but Mastermind scores are sparse. Here are the possible packed scores for a 4 pin game:

    00 01 02 03 04  10 11 12 13  20 21 22  30  40

It is common for implementations to want to record, say, the number of guesses which produce each score. See, for example,
Knuth's algorithm in [1].
One could use a 2D array and index with `[b][w]`, resulting in 25 cells for a 4 pin game, half of them wasted.
One could instead use a 1D array and index with the packed decimal score, resulting in 41 cells and more waste, or use
the packed hex score with 65 cells and even more waste. Even representing the scores as base-*p* numbers results
in 30% waste.

It's worth noting that the total number of distinct score values is given by[2]:

> *t = (p * (p + 3)) / 2*

Given the numbers involved are quite small, it's reasonable for most implementations to choose any of methods above, 
even for larger games. In fact, the CPU implementations here do precisely this, trading the simplicity of a sparse array
against the cost of anything more complex. 

However, certain kinds of GPU memory are quite limited, and parallelizing interesting gameplay algorithms on the GPU
requires careful use of shared "threadgroup" memory. Wasting half of it or more is unacceptable.

Some implementations may choose to use a sparse lookup table to translate scores to a dense range, and others employ
(possibly large) switch statements. Neither of these are particularly good on the GPU either. 

## Dense Packing

To form a dense index for Mastermind scores, note first that all valid scores sum to the 
number of pins *p*, i.e., *b + w = p*. Grouping scores by *b*, the number of scores with *b = 0* is *p + 1*, 
with *b = 1* is *p*,
and with *b = 2* is *p - 1*, 
and so on until *b = p* with just a single score.

At this point you may note that the score *b = p - 1*, *w = 1*, is not possible. That would say that all colors in the
guess are correct but only one of them is in the wrong place. That's clearly physically impossible, so there is a hole
in the sequence suggested above. We will temporarily ignore that and assume that such a score is possible. 

Given that, the size of each successive group of scores with a given black value *GS<sub>b</sub>* is given by:

To give all scores an ordinal *O<sub>b,w</sub>* we need to know the starting 
number *GB<sub>b</sub>* of each group, then simply add *w*. 

![x](images/ScoreOrdinals/Eq_Obw_1.svg)

Observe that each subsequent group size *GS<sub>i</sub>* decreases by one until *GS<sub>p</sub> = 1*, 
and that *GB<sub>i</sub>* is therefore the sum of all *GS<sub>0</sub>* to *GS<sub>i - 1</sub>*.

![x](images/ScoreOrdinals/Eq_GB_b_2.svg)

![x](images/ScoreOrdinals/Eq_GB_b_3.svg)

In a scoring function which computes the black hits *b* and all hits *ah*, both black and white, the number of white hits
is given by *w = ah - b*. Thus,

It turns out that isn't too bad to compute at all, and it saves significant thread group memory on the GPU, enabling
better occupancy and thus throughput.

Note, however, that the packing is not perfect. The equations above leaves room for the impossible score *b = p - 1*, *w = 1*.
This can be adjusted for programmatically, by subtracting 1 if *b == p*, but it's not worth it in this case. The extra
word of memory is expendable vs. having the GPU execute an `if` statement.

A visual representation is helpful to understanding the above equations. For a 5 pin game:

```
Score:            00 01 02 03 04 05    10 11 12 13 14    20 21 22 23    30 31 32     40 xx        50
Ordinal:           0  1  2  3  4  5     6  7  8  9 10    11 12 13 14    15 16 17     18 19        20
Size vs. first:    0                   -1                -2             -3           -4           -5
Starting ordinal:                      1(p+1) - 0        2(p+1) - 1     3(p+1) - 3   4(p+1) - 6   5(p+1) - 10
```

I.e., subtract the running sum of *'Size vs. first'* from *b(p+1)*.

\begin{document}

$GS_b$: size of each group of scores with a given black value.

$GS_b = p + 1 - b$

$GB_b$: beginning index of each group of scores with a given black value.

\[ GB_b = \sum_{n=0}^{b-1}{(p+1-n)} \]


\[ GB_b = \sum_{n=0}^{b-1}(p+1) - \sum_{n=0}^{b-1} n \]

\[ GB_b = b(p + 1) - \frac{(b - 1)b}{2} \]

So the starting index of each score is

\[ GB_b = b(p + 1) - \frac{(b - 1)b}{2} + w\]


Given $w = ah - b$, and that we compute $ah$ and $b$ only:

\[ GB_b = b(p + 1) - \frac{(b - 1)b}{2} + (ah - b)\]

\[ GB_b = bp + b - \frac{(b - 1)b}{2} + ah - b\]

\[ GB_b = bp - \frac{(b - 1)b}{2} + ah\]
